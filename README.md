# Book Listing App

This is an Android app which fetches book information from the Google Books API based on a user search term.  It is a simple project designed to demonstrate networking functionality in Android.

This app was created by a Udacity employee during the development of the Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree program.  You *may not use code from this app in a Udacity submission*.
